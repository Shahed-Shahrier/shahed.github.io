# shahed.github.io — Portfolio for Shahed Shahrier (bornohin)

This is a small static portfolio site scaffold. It uses your four images placed under `assets/` as follows:
- assets/image1.jpg — hero / profile photo (used as requested)
- assets/image2.jpg — achievement / project thumbnail 1
- assets/image3.jpg — achievement / project thumbnail 2
- assets/image4.jpg — achievement / project thumbnail 3
- (optional) assets/favicon.png

How to use
1. Add images to the repository at `assets/image1.jpg`, `assets/image2.jpg`, `assets/image3.jpg`, `assets/image4.jpg`.
2. Commit and push the files to your repository (root). GitHub Pages will serve the site from the main branch if enabled.
3. Edit `index.html` to update project links, email, or LinkedIn URL.
